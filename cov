This series implements SBI PMU improvements done in SBI v2.0[1] i.e. PMU snapshot
and fw_read_hi() functions. 

SBI v2.0 introduced PMU snapshot feature which allows the SBI implementation
to provide counter information (i.e. values/overlfow status) via a shared
memory between the SBI implementation and supervisor OS. This allows to minimize
the number of traps in when perf being used inside a kvm guest as it relies on
SBI PMU + trap/emulation of the counters. 

The current set of ratified RISC-V specification also doesn't allow scountovf
to be trap/emulated by the hypervisor. The SBI PMU snapshot bridges the gap
in ISA as well and enables perf sampling in the guest. However, LCOFI in the
guest only works via IRQ filtering in AIA specification. That's why, AIA
has to be enabled in the hardware (at least the Ssaia extension) in order to
use the sampling support in the perf. 

Here are the patch wise implementation details.

PATCH 1-2 : Generic cleanups/improvements.
PATCH 3,4,9 : FW_READ_HI function implementation
PATCH 5-6: Add PMU snapshot feature in sbi pmu driver
PATCH 7-8: KVM implementation for snapshot and sampling in kvm guests

The series is based on v6.70-rc3 and is available at:

https://github.com/atishp04/linux/tree/kvm_pmu_snapshot_v1

The kvmtool patch is also available at:
https://github.com/atishp04/kvmtool/tree/sscofpmf

It also requires Ssaia ISA extension to be present in the hardware in order to
get perf sampling support in the guest. In Qemu virt machine, it can be done
by the following config.

```
-cpu rv64,sscofpmf=true,x-ssaia=true
```

There is no other dependancies on AIA apart from that. Thus, Ssaia must be disabled
for the guest if AIA patches are not available. Here is the example command.

```
./lkvm-static run -m 256 -c2 --console serial -p "console=ttyS0 earlycon" --disable-ssaia -k ./Image --debug 
```

The series has been tested only in Qemu.
Here is the snippet of the perf running inside a kvm guest.
