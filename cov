The Supervisor Binary Interface(SBI) specification[1] now defines a
base extension that provides extendability to add future extensions
while maintaining backward compatibility with previous versions.
The new version is defined as 0.2 and older version is marked as 0.1.

This series adds following features to RISC-V Linux KVM.
1. Adds support for SBI v0.2 in KVM
2. SBI Hart state management extension (HSM) in KVM
3. Ordered booting of guest vcpus in guest Linux
4. SBI Reset extension in KVM

This series depends on the base kvm support series v16[2].

Guest kernel needs to also support SBI v0.2 and HSM extension in Kernel
to boot multiple vcpus. Linux kernel supports both starting v5.7.
In absense of that, guest can only boot 1 vcpu.

Changes from v1->v2:
1. Sent the patch 1 separately as it can merged independently.
2. Added Reset extension functionality.

Tested on Qemu and FPGA with Rocket core design.
